##### In my opinion, React Native can be used in 90% of projects. However, they are some cases where you are better off coding in native. If you say no to all of this questions then React Native is definitely for you.

## 1. Do you need to target both platform?
If you only target 1 platform then the benefit of React Native might not be so clear.(I still think you should consider React Native)

## 2. Do you use alot of native module?
If you are planning to use a lot of native API then you should first check to see whether there is already an existing library for React Native. Although you can still use native API by using the bridge module it would still take considerable amount of effort.

## 3. Does your app uses alot of animation?
If your app depends alot on animation like games then React Native might not be suitable.
