##### Here are some of React Native youtube videos that I used to learn in the beginning.

## 1. [React Native navigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C96piR3FRww)
There are a few implementation of react navigation but the most stable and popular is [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/). It combines all the knowledge from previous react navigation library. This video explain how to implement it into your own project.

## 2. [React Native and Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3msLwu25SQY&list=PLk083BmAphjtGWyZUuo1BiCS_ZAgps6j5)
This video explain how to implement Redux into React Native from ground up. It's a good video for newbie because not only does it teach about Redux, but it also show the folder structure that can be used for your own project. You should definitely watch this video **AFTER** you are comfortable with React Native.
